# Client Side Hydration

Hydration refers to the client-side process during which Vue takes over the static HTML sent by the server and turns it into dynamic DOM that can react to client-side data changes.

In `entry-client.js`, we are simply mounting the app with this line:

```js
// this assumes App.vue template root element has `id="app"`
app.mount('#app')
```

Since the server has already rendered the markup, we obviously do not want to throw that away and re-create all the DOM elements. Instead, we want to "hydrate" the static markup and make it interactive.

Vue provides a `createSSRApp` method for use in client-side code (in this case, in our `entry-client.js`) to tell Vue to hydrate the existing static HTML instead of re-creating all the DOM elements.

In development mode, Vue will assert the client-side generated virtual DOM tree matches the DOM structure rendered from the server. If there is a mismatch, it will bail hydration, discard existing DOM and render from scratch. **In production mode, this assertion is disabled for maximum performance.**

### Hydration Caveats

One thing to be aware of when using SSR + client hydration is some special HTML structures that may be altered by the browser. For example, when you write this in a Vue template:

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>hi</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

The browser will automatically inject `<tbody>` inside `<table>`, however, the virtual DOM generated by Vue does not contain `<tbody>`, so it will cause a mismatch. To ensure correct matching, make sure to write valid HTML in your templates.

You might consider using a HTML validator like [the W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) or [HTML-validate](https://html-validate.org/) to check your templates in development.
